== Description ==

This plugin must be used in combination with WooCommerce and Polylang. It allows you to translate the WooCommerce pages, simple, variable and grouped products, categories, tags, attributes directly in the WooCommerce interface. Common data such as the stock and prices are automatically synchronized across products translations. And of course, emails are sent to customers in their language.

Some popular extensions such as WooCommerce Subscriptions, Dynamic Pricing, Table Rate shipping, WooCommerce Bookings have been integrated too. More will come in the future.

This extension can be used either with the free version of Polylang or in combination with Polylang Pro.
